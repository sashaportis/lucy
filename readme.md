This is the website for Lucy Skaer

## Installation

Clone this repo and in the directory run

```bash
npm install
```

## Usage

To work on the project in the directory run ```gulp``` which will start development server running at http://127.0.0.1:9000.
```bash
gulp
```

To use the Kirby panel you must run a local server (such as MAMP) as browsersync doesn't seem to work when uploading images.
